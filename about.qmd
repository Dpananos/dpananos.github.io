I'm a Senior Statistics Engineer [Eppo](https://www.geteppo.com/).  Previously, I was a staff data scientist at Zapier.  While there, I lead experimentation and consulted or analyzed on 50+ experiments.

As of late, my professional work has leaned more towards causal inference and experimentation than machine learning.

When I'm not doing statistics, I'm playing fetch with my dog Cauchy.
