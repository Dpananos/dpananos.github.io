I'm a Senior Software Engineer [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).  Previously, I was a Statistical Engineer at Eppo (which was acquired by Datadog), and a Staff Data Scientist at Zapier.  While at Zapier, I lead experimentation and consulted on or analyzed 50+ experiments.

I'm generally interested in building products for causal inference and experimentation.

When I'm not doing statistics, I'm playing fetch with my dog Cauchy.
